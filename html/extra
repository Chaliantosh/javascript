<br/> - this will impact responsive designing in webpage so not recommended to used
<hr/> - this tag will draw a horizantal line when used.
<center> - this tag will get the content in the center of the page. This will show in red because this should be done thru CSS.
<img src="loc of file" alt="text if location is incorrect" title="tool tip"> ==> point to note is that title can work as an alt as well; if there is no alt mentioned in the tag. But alt is important and for every image alt is important. SEO (alt plays an important role in Search Engine Optimization)
<link href="images/NareshIT.png" rel="icon"> - this is used to add favicon which means it adds the icon next to the title. href refers to hyper reference and rel refers to related to.
