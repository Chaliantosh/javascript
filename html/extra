two levels of tags

<br/> - this will impact responsive designing in webpage so not recommended to used
<hr/> - this tag will draw a horizantal line when used.
<center> - this tag will get the content in the center of the page. This will show in red because this should be done thru CSS.
<img src="loc of file" alt="text if location is incorrect" title="tool tip"> ==> point to note is that title can work as an alt as well; if there is no alt mentioned in the tag. But alt is important and for every image alt is important. SEO (alt plays an important role in Search Engine Optimization)
<link href="images/NareshIT.png" rel="icon"> - this is used to add favicon which means it adds the icon next to the title. href refers to hyper reference and rel refers to related to.
meta tag should be included in theh html to make it more searchable.
        <meta name="description" content="description about website"/>
        <meta name="description" content="santosh chalivendri"/>
anchor tag allows one webpage to redirect to other webpages either internal or external. target="_blank opens the new page in the new window retaining the original page.

There are three ways to add CSS to html page. 
> inline: when we write CSS in html tag
> styletag: when we add style tag in head
> stylesheet: keping CSS separate

Prioirty: 
> inline has highest priority followed by styletag and finally stylesheet.
For e.g.: 
if h1 has all the different ways of calling CSS:

h1
Inline
{
        color:red,
        font-size:30px
}
styletag
{
        color:orange,
        text-align:center
}
stylesheet
{
        font-size:30px,
        text-align:right,
        font-wieght:bold
}

As per the priority (inline has higher, followed up styletag & stylesheet), following properties will be applied:
h1
{
        color:red,
        font-size:30px,
        text-align:center,
        font-wieght:bold
}

Three ways to mention color proprty in CSS:
> mention color name
> mention color code (HEX)
> mention RGB code

CSS Color Properties:
> Always try to give height in the pixel and width in the %, because it will take the screen size.

float:left: 
> With this category items will come in one line.
